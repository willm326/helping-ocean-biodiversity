  - 'This morning, a dead vaquita was found on the shoreline just a couple miles
    away from residency. '
  - 'However, no one heard it''s last dying cries, and it was found already dead
    by an old couple walking the beach. '
  - 'It''s a shame that they did not find it in time, but luckily we were able to
    spare anyone else from its gruesome state. '
  - Remember, if any of you ever find an injured or ill creature you'll report it
    to animal control or inform the wildlife services immediately.
