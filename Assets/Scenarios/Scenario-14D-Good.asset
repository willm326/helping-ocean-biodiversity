  - 'Just recently, a manatee was saved from toxicity in the water by a local resident. '
  - 'However, the manatee will need to be in human supervision before released to
    make sure the toxic waste completely leaves it''s system and habitat. '
  - Thank you to this random kind stranger, and hopefully, if any of you ever find
    an injured or ill creature you'll report it to animal control or inform the wildlife
    services immediately.
