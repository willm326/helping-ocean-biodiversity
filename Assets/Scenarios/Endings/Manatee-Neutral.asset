  sentences:
  - 'Just recently, a manatee was found dead near the tide pools. '
  - Sadly, it was in a more secluded area where people don't normally go.
  - It seemed to have consumed some kind of toxic chemical.
  - 'Wildlife services is currently looking out for any manatees that may have also
    been affected. '
  - Remember folks, if any of you ever find an injured or ill creature you'll report
    it to animal control or inform the wildlife services immediately.
