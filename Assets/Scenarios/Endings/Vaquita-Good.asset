  sentences:
  - 'This morning, a resident found a vaquita off the shore, tangled by nets. '
  - 'Luckily, it was found and rescued or there would''ve been one less from this
    critically endangered species. '
  - 'It is a miracle that this creature survived after being stranded on the shoreline
    and injured for so long. '
  - Thank you to this random kind stranger, and hopefully, if any of you ever find
    an injured creature you report it to animal control or inform the wildlife services
    immediately.
