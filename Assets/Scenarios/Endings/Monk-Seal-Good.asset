  sentences:
  - 'Earlier today, a resident helped the local Monk Seals that inhabit the beach
    by directing people to not take pictures. '
  - Many people still don't know that taking pictures of monk seals, or many animals
    in general causes them stress.
  - Thank you to this random kind stranger, and hopefully, if any of you come across
    a situation like this, you can help put it to a stop as well and help these endangered
    animals.
